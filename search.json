[{"title":"large language model","url":"/2025/07/19/ai/01-ai-foundation/","content":"Large Language ModelDefinitionA large language model is a machine learning model that is trained on a large corpus of text data, such as Wikipedia or the Web. These models can generate high-quality text that is similar to the training data, but can also generate text that is not present in the training data.\nHistory\n&lt; 1990s: IBM’s statistical language model (SLM)\n1990s-2000s: Neural language models (NLLMs)\n2001s: n-gram model\n2010s: GPT-2, GPT-3\n\nDataset PreprocessingTokenizationSplitting the text into individual words or sub-words\n\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE): A sub-word unit that is used to represent a word in a sequence. It is a compression algorithm that merges frequent sub-words into a single token.\n\nDataset cleaning\nRemove stop words: Common words that do not provide any useful information\nStemming: Reducing words to their root form\nLemmatization: Reducing words to their base form\n\nSynthetic DataSynthetic data is a technique used to generate new data by combining existing data. It can be used to train a language model on a small dataset and then use it to generate new text.\nTrainingCost\nTraining time: The amount of time it takes to train a large language model\nMemory usage: The amount of memory required to train a large language model\nGPU usage: The amount of GPU memory required to train a large language model\n\nFine-tuningFine-tuning is a technique used to adapt a pre-trained language model to a specific task. It involves unfreezing the layers of the model and re-training them on a new task.\nArchitectureAttention Mechanism and context windowThe attention mechanism is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the output. It is based on the context window, which is a window of words that surrounds the current word. The attention mechanism allows the model to pay more attention to the relevant parts of the input sequence, while ignoring irrelevant parts.\nMixture of expertsThe mixture of experts (MoE) is a technique used to train a large language model that can generate text with multiple experts. It is based on the idea that multiple experts can generate different parts of the text, and the model can combine the outputs of these experts to generate the final output.\nParameter sizeThe parameter size of a large language model is the amount of memory required to store its weights. It is important to consider the size of the model when choosing the hardware resources required to train it.\n\nQuantization: Reducing the size of the model by reducing the number of bits used to represent the weights.\n\nReferencesLarge Language Models\nArtificial IntelligenceConceptArtificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. It involves the use of computational processes to simulate intelligent behavior. The term “intelligence” refers to the ability of a machine to acquire and apply knowledge and skills, and to reason and problem-solve autonomously.\nTechniques\nMachine Learning: The process of training a machine to learn from experience and improve its performance on a task.\nDeep Learning: A subset of machine learning that involves training a machine to learn from large datasets using neural networks.\nNatural Language Processing: The use of AI to understand and manipulate human language.\n\nReferencesArtificial Intelligence\nProduces\nGPT\nClaude\nGemini\nLlama\nMistral Large\nGrok\nDeekseek\nTongyi\nKimi\n\n\n","categories":["ai","foundation","large language model"],"tags":["ai"]},{"title":"large language model","url":"/2025/07/19/ai/02-ai-deep-learning/","content":"ReferencesDive Into Deep Learning\nCreate Environmentuse conda or minicondaconda env remove d2l-zhconda create -n d2l-zh -y python=3.8 pipconda activate d2l-zh\ninstall dependenciespip install jupyter d2l torch torchvision\ndownload d2l-zh.zipwget http://zh-v2.d2l.ai/d2l-zh.zipunzip d2l-zh.zipjupyter notebook\n","categories":["ai","foundation","large language model"],"tags":["ai"]},{"title":"Azure Container registries","url":"/2025/07/14/azure/01-container-registries/","content":"After building our artifacts, we need a place to store them.

For non-concurrent cases, use HashMap. Avoid Hashtable in modern code.\nHow does equals() and hashCode() work together in collections?\nhashCode(): Returns an integer hash value used to place objects in hash-based collections (like HashMap, HashSet).\nequals(): Compares two objects for logical equality.\n\nContract:\n\nIf two objects are equal according to equals(), they must have the same hashCode().\nIf two objects have the same hashCode(), they may or may not be equal.\n\nWhy it matters:    Collections like HashMap use hashCode() to find a bucket, and then equals() to check if the key already exists.Example:@Overridepublic boolean equals(Object o) &#123;    if (this == o) return true;    if (!(o instanceof Person)) return false;    Person p = (Person) o;    return id == p.id;&#125;@Overridepublic int hashCode() &#123;    return Objects.hash(id);&#125;\nDifference between shallow copy vs deep copy in Java.\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nShallow Copy\nCopies only object references (not the objects they refer to). Both objects share the same nested objects.\nclone() without custom implementation\n\n\nDeep Copy\nCopies everything — including new instances of nested objects. Changes in one object don’t affect the other.\nImplemented manually or via serialization\n\n\n\n\nExample:// Shallow copyEmployee e2 = e1.clone(); // e1.address and e2.address point to same object// Deep copyEmployee e2 = new Employee(e1);e2.address = new Address(e1.address);\nHow do you prevent deadlock in multithreaded applications?Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other’s locks.\nWays to prevent it:\n\nLock ordering – Always acquire locks in a consistent order.\nTry-lock with timeout – Use tryLock() from ReentrantLock to avoid waiting forever.\nAvoid nested locks – Reduce code sections that acquire multiple locks.\nUse concurrent utilities – Prefer ConcurrentHashMap, BlockingQueue, etc., which manage synchronization internally.\nMinimize synchronized blocks – Keep critical sections small.\n\nExample:if (lock1.tryLock(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) &#123;    if (lock2.tryLock(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) &#123;        // work    &#125;&#125;\nExplain volatile vs synchronized — when to use each.\n\n\n\nFeature\nvolatile\nsynchronized\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nGuarantees visibility of changes across threads\nGuarantees atomicity and visibility\n\n\nUse Case\nWhen multiple threads read/write a variable, and writes are independent\nWhen operations on shared data must be atomic\n\n\nLocking\nNo locking (lighter, faster)\nUses intrinsic lock (can block threads)\n\n\nScope\nVariable-level only\nCode block or method\n\n\nExample Use\nStatus flags, configuration values\nCounters, complex state updates\n\n\n\n\nExample:volatile boolean running = true; // visibility onlysynchronized void increment() &#123;  // atomic operation    count++;&#125;Rule of thumb:\n\nUse volatile for simple flags or status updates.\nUse synchronized (or locks) for compound operations that must be atomic.\n\nSpring &amp; Spring BootDifference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.Spring provides several stereotype annotations to define beans, which also give semantic meaning for better readability:\n\n\n\n\nAnnotation\nPurpose\nSpecial Behavior\n\n\n\n\n@Component\nGeneric stereotype for any Spring-managed component\nBase annotation for all other stereotypes\n\n\n@Service\nIndicates a service layer component (business logic)\nMainly semantic, no extra behavior, improves readability\n\n\n@Repository\nIndicates a DAO (Data Access Object) component\nConverts database exceptions into Spring’s DataAccessException\n\n\n@Controller\nIndicates a web controller handling HTTP requests\nTypically used with @RequestMapping to handle endpoints; works with Spring MVC\n\n\n\n\nSummary:All are detected via component scanning and registered as Spring beans, but @Repository and @Controller have additional framework-specific roles.\nWhat is Spring Boot auto-configuration? How does it work internally?Auto-configuration is a key feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures your application based on the dependencies on the classpath and properties defined in application.properties or application.yml.\nHow it works internally:\n\nSpring Boot uses the @SpringBootApplication annotation, which includes @EnableAutoConfiguration.\n@EnableAutoConfiguration imports spring.factories which lists all auto-configuration classes.\nDuring startup, Spring Boot evaluates each auto-configuration class using @Conditional annotations (e.g., @ConditionalOnClass, @ConditionalOnMissingBean) to decide which beans to create.\nBeans are registered automatically based on what classes and libraries are available on the classpath.\n\nExample:If spring-boot-starter-data-jpa is on the classpath, Spring Boot auto-configures EntityManagerFactory and DataSource beans automatically.\nHow do you implement exception handling globally in Spring Boot REST APIs?Spring Boot provides @ControllerAdvice for global exception handling.\nSteps:\n\nCreate a class annotated with @ControllerAdvice.\nDefine methods annotated with @ExceptionHandler to handle specific exceptions.\nOptionally, use @ResponseStatus or return a custom response body.\n\nExample:\n@ControllerAdvicepublic class GlobalExceptionHandler &#123;    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; handleResourceNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) &#123;        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());    &#125;    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; handleGenericException(Exception ex) &#123;        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)                             .body(&quot;Something went wrong: &quot; + ex.getMessage());    &#125;&#125;\nExplain difference between @RequestParam, @PathVariable, and @RequestBody.\n\n\n\nAnnotation\nUsage\nExample\n\n\n\n\n@RequestParam\nBinds query parameters or form data\nGET /users?id=123 → @RequestParam(&quot;id&quot;) Long id\n\n\n@PathVariable\nBinds URI template variables\nGET /users/123 → @PathVariable(&quot;id&quot;) Long id\n\n\n@RequestBody\nBinds HTTP request body (JSON/XML) to Java object\nPOST /users with JSON &#123; &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot; &#125; → @RequestBody User user\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\n@RequestParam → query/form parameters\n@PathVariable → path segments\n@RequestBody → request body content\n\nHow do you implement profiles in Spring Boot for multiple environments?Spring Boot supports profiles to separate environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod).\nSteps:\n\nCreate profile-specific properties files:\napplication-dev.properties\napplication-prod.properties\n\n\nActivate a profile:\nIn application.properties:spring.profiles.active=dev\nOr via command line:java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod\n\n\nUse @Profile annotation to conditionally load beans:@Configuration@Profile(&quot;dev&quot;)public class DevConfig &#123;    @Bean    public DataSource devDataSource() &#123;        return new HikariDataSource();    &#125;&#125;\nSummary:Profiles allow you to maintain different configurations for different environments while keeping a single codebase.\n\nJPA / HibernateWhat are entity states (Transient, Persistent, Detached, Removed) in Hibernate?In Hibernate, an entity can exist in one of four states:\n\n\n\n\nState\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nTransient\nThe entity is not associated with a Hibernate Session and not persisted in the database.\nUser user = new User(); (new object, no save() called)\n\n\nPersistent\nThe entity is associated with a Hibernate Session and changes will be automatically synchronized with the database.\nsession.save(user);\n\n\nDetached\nThe entity was persistent, but the session is closed or entity is evicted. Changes are not automatically persisted.\nsession.close(); user.setName(&quot;John&quot;);\n\n\nRemoved\nThe entity is scheduled for deletion. It will be deleted when the transaction commits.\nsession.delete(user);\n\n\n\n\nExplain lazy loading and how to avoid LazyInitializationException.Lazy loading is when Hibernate delays loading of associated entities until they are actually accessed.\n\nExample:  @Entityclass Department &#123;    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)    private List&lt;Employee&gt; employees;&#125;\nemployees are loaded from the database only when getEmployees() is called.\n\nLazyInitializationException occurs if you try to access a lazily loaded collection outside an active session.\nWays to avoid it:\n\nOpen Session in View (not recommended for all cases): Keep session open during view rendering.\nFetch join in JPQL: SELECT d FROM Department d JOIN FETCH d.employees WHERE d.id = :id\nEager fetching (careful with performance): @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)\nInitialize collection manually before session closes: Hibernate.initialize(department.getEmployees());\n\n\nDifference between Criteria API and JPQL.\n\n\n\nFeature\nJPQL\nCriteria API\n\n\n\n\nQuery Type\nString-based queries\nObject-oriented, type-safe queries\n\n\nCompile-time safety\nNo\nYes\n\n\nReadability\nSimple for static queries\nBetter for dynamic queries\n\n\n\n\nExample// SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.age &gt; 25CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();CriteriaQuery&lt;User&gt; cq = cb.createQuery(User.class);Root&lt;User&gt; user = cq.from(User.class);cq.select(user).where(cb.gt(user.get(&quot;age&quot;), 25));\nWhat is the difference between CascadeType.ALL and orphanRemoval?\n\n\n\nFeature\nCascadeType.ALL\norphanRemoval = true\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nApplies all operations (persist, merge, remove, refresh) from parent to child\nDeletes child entities when they are removed from parent collection\n\n\nExample\nSaving parent automatically saves child\nRemoving a child from parent’s collection deletes it from DB\n\n\nKey Difference\nCascade propagates operations, not necessarily removal\nOrphan removal only deletes orphans but doesn’t cascade persist\n\n\n\n\nExample:@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)private List&lt;Employee&gt; employees;\n\ncascade = ALL → persisting parent also persists employees\norphanRemoval = true → removing employee from list deletes it from DB\n\nHow do you implement pagination and sorting in Spring Data JPA?Spring Data JPA provides Pageable and Sort interfaces for pagination and sorting.\nExample:@Repositorypublic interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt; &#123;    Page&lt;User&gt; findByAgeGreaterThan(int age, Pageable pageable);&#125;Usage in service:Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 10, Sort.by(&quot;name&quot;).ascending());Page&lt;User&gt; users = userRepository.findByAgeGreaterThan(25, pageable);users.getContent().forEach(System.out::println);System.out.println(&quot;Total pages: &quot; + users.getTotalPages());\n\nPageRequest.of(page, size, sort) specifies page number, page size, and sorting.\nReturns a Page which contains content, total pages, total elements, and more.\n\nMicroservices &amp; ArchitectureExplain difference between monolithic and microservices architectures.\n\n\n\nAspect\nMonolithic Architecture\nMicroservices Architecture\n\n\n\n\nStructure\nSingle unified codebase\nCollection of small, independent services\n\n\nDeployment\nOne deployable unit\nEach service deployed independently\n\n\nScaling\nScale entire application\nScale individual services as needed\n\n\nTechnology Stack\nUsually uniform\nCan use different stacks per service\n\n\nFault Isolation\nFailure in one module may affect entire app\nFailures isolated to the specific service\n\n\nDevelopment Speed\nSlower for large teams\nFaster with independent teams\n\n\n\n\nSummary:Monolith = single large app; Microservices = many small, loosely coupled apps that communicate over APIs.\nHow do you implement inter-service communication? (REST, Kafka, gRPC)Microservices need to communicate with each other. Common methods:\n\nREST (HTTP/JSON)  \nSimple, widely used, synchronous request-response.  \nExample:@GetMapping(&quot;/users/&#123;id&#125;&quot;)public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) &#123; ... &#125;\n\n\nKafka (Event-driven messaging)\nAsynchronous, decoupled communication using topics.\nExample: Service A produces events → Service B consumes events.\n\n\ngRPC (Remote Procedure Calls)\nHigh-performance, strongly typed, binary protocol using Protocol Buffers.\nExample:service UserService &#123;    rpc GetUser(UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);&#125;\nSummary:\n\n\n\n\nREST → synchronous, simple\nKafka → asynchronous, decoupled\ngRPC → synchronous or streaming, high performance\n\nWhat is API Gateway and why do we need it?An API Gateway is a single entry point for clients to interact with multiple microservices.\nResponsibilities:\n\nRouting requests to appropriate microservices\nRequest aggregation (combine multiple service responses)\nAuthentication &amp; authorization\nRate limiting, caching, logging\n\nExample:\n\nNetflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, NGINX\n\nSummary:API Gateway simplifies client interaction, hides service complexity, and provides cross-cutting features in one place.\nHow do you manage configuration in multiple microservices?For multiple services, externalized and centralized configuration is recommended.\nApproaches:\n\nSpring Cloud Config\nCentral config server serving properties via Git/Filesystem.\nServices fetch config dynamically.\n\n\nEnvironment variables / Kubernetes ConfigMaps &amp; Secrets\nStore environment-specific configuration outside code.\n\n\nConsul / etcd\nDistributed configuration with service discovery integration.\n\n\n\nExample with Spring Cloud Config:spring:  application:    name: user-service  cloud:    config:      uri: http://config-server:8888\nExplain circuit breaker pattern (Hystrix/Resilience4j) with example.The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures in microservices when one service is down or slow.\nHow it works:\n\nCircuit is closed → calls pass normally.\nIf failures exceed threshold → circuit opens → further calls fail fast.\nAfter a timeout → circuit half-open → test a few requests before closing.\n\nExample with Resilience4j (Spring Boot):@Servicepublic class UserService &#123;    @CircuitBreaker(name = &quot;userService&quot;, fallbackMethod = &quot;fallbackGetUser&quot;)    public User getUser(Long id) &#123;        // Call external service    &#125;    public User fallbackGetUser(Long id, Throwable t) &#123;        return new User(id, &quot;Default User&quot;);    &#125;&#125;Summary:Circuit breakers improve system resilience by preventing cascading failures and allowing graceful degradation.\nCloud &amp; DevOps BasicsWhat is the difference between Docker image and Docker container?\n\n\n\nAspect\nDocker Image\nDocker Container\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nRead-only template with application and dependencies\nRunning instance of an image\n\n\nLifecycle\nImmutable, stored in registry\nCreated, started, stopped, or destroyed\n\n\nPurpose\nUsed to build containers\nExecutes the application\n\n\nExample\nmyapp:1.0 image\ndocker run myapp:1.0 creates a container\n\n\n\n\nSummary:Image = blueprint; Container = running instance of that blueprint.\nHow does Kubernetes handle scaling and service discovery?Scaling:  \n\nKubernetes can automatically scale pods using:\nManual scaling: kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=5\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically adjusts replicas based on CPU/memory metrics.\n\n\n\nService Discovery:  \n\nPods are ephemeral; services use DNS names for discovery.\nKubernetes Service creates a stable IP and DNS name for a set of pods.  \nExample: http://user-service.default.svc.cluster.local\n\nExplain difference between Blue-Green and Rolling deployments.\n\n\n\nAspect\nBlue-Green Deployment\nRolling Deployment\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nTwo identical environments: Blue (current) &amp; Green (new)\nUpdate pods gradually with new version\n\n\nDowntime\nNear-zero downtime\nMinimal downtime during updates\n\n\nRollback\nSimple: switch traffic back to old environment\nRollback requires reverting pods\n\n\nComplexity\nRequires double resources\nResource-efficient\n\n\n\n\nHow do you monitor Spring Boot microservices in production (Actuator, ELK, Prometheus)?1. Spring Boot Actuator:  \n\nExposes metrics, health checks, and info endpoints.  \nExample: /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics\n\n2. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):  \n\nCentralized logging for multiple microservices.  \nCollect logs with Logstash → store in Elasticsearch → visualize in Kibana.\n\n3. Prometheus &amp; Grafana:  \n\nPrometheus scrapes metrics from Actuator endpoints.  \nGrafana visualizes metrics in dashboards.  \nExample:  management:endpoints:    web:    exposure:        include: health, metrics, prometheus\n\n\nWhat is CI/CD? How have you implemented it in your projects?CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment.\n\nContinuous Integration (CI): Automatically build and test code whenever changes are pushed.\nContinuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploy code to staging/production after passing tests.\n\nTypical Implementation:\n\nUse GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI to build, test, and package Spring Boot services into Docker images.\nPush Docker images to Docker Registry (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR).\nDeploy images to Kubernetes or cloud environment.\nAutomated tests and monitoring ensure quality and quick rollback if needed.\n\nExample GitHub Actions snippet:name: CI/CD Pipelineon: [push]jobs:  build:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: Build Docker image        run: docker build -t myapp:$&#123;&#123; github.sha &#125;&#125; .      - name: Push to registry        run: docker push myapp:$&#123;&#123; github.sha &#125;&#125;\nSQL / Database KnowledgeWrite a SQL query to get department-wise average salary.SELECT     department_id,    AVG(salary) AS avg_salaryFROM employeesGROUP BY department_idORDER BY avg_salary DESC;\nExplanation:\n\nGROUP BY groups rows by department.\nAVG() calculates the average salary per department.\nORDER BY sorts the results (optional).\n\nDifference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN.\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExample Result\n\n\n\n\nINNER JOIN\nReturns only rows with matching values in both tables.\nEmployees that belong to a department.\n\n\nLEFT JOIN\nReturns all rows from the left table, even if no match exists in the right table.\nAll employees, with department info if available.\n\n\nRIGHT JOIN\nReturns all rows from the right table, even if no match exists in the left table.\nAll departments, even those with no employees.\n\n\nFULL JOIN\nReturns all rows from both tables, with NULL for missing matches.\nAll employees and departments, matched where possible.\n\n\n\n\nExample:SELECT e.name, d.name AS departmentFROM employees eLEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;\nHow do you optimize slow-running SQL queries?\nAnalyze the query plan\nUse EXPLAIN (MySQL, PostgreSQL) to view execution details.\nIdentify full table scans, missing indexes, or inefficient joins.\n\n\nCreate appropriate indexes\nAdd indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.\n\n\nReduce data retrieval\nUse SELECT specific_columns instead of SELECT *.\nApply filters and limits.\n\n\nOptimize joins and subqueries\nPrefer joins over nested subqueries when possible.\n\n\nUse caching\nCache frequent queries (e.g., Redis, Memcached).\n\n\nPartition large tables\nImproves performance on very large datasets.\n\n\n\nExplain ACID properties and isolation levels in databases.ACID Properties\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAtomicity\nAll operations in a transaction succeed or none do.\n\n\nConsistency\nDatabase remains valid before and after the transaction.\n\n\nIsolation\nTransactions do not interfere with each other.\n\n\nDurability\nOnce committed, data changes persist even after failures.\n\n\n\n\nIsolation Levels\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\nCommon Problems Prevented\n\n\n\n\nREAD UNCOMMITTED\nTransactions can read uncommitted data (dirty reads).\nNone\n\n\nREAD COMMITTED\nPrevents dirty reads, allows non-repeatable reads.\nDirty reads\n\n\nREPEATABLE READ\nPrevents dirty and non-repeatable reads, but phantom reads may occur.\nDirty, non-repeatable reads\n\n\nSERIALIZABLE\nHighest level, ensures full isolation (transactions run sequentially).\nAll\n\n\n\n\nHow do you use indexes, and what are clustered vs non-clustered indexes?What is an index?An index improves data retrieval speed by allowing the database to find rows quickly, similar to a book index.\nSyntax Example:CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);Types of Indexes\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nClustered Index\nPhysically sorts and stores table data based on the index key. One per table.\nPRIMARY KEY automatically creates a clustered index.\n\n\nNon-Clustered Index\nStores index separately from table data, containing pointers to the actual rows.\nUsed for frequently queried columns not part of the primary key.\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nClustered = data sorted by index\nNon-clustered = separate lookup structure\n\nBest Practices:\n\nUse indexes on columns often used in filters and joins.\nAvoid over-indexing (it slows down inserts/updates).\nRegularly monitor and rebuild fragmented indexes.\n\nDSA &amp;

It consists of a large number of network traffic records that are labeled as either normal or malicious. The dataset contains a total of 41,478 network traffic records, which are categorized into 10 different types of attacks, such as DoS, Probe, U2R, R2L, etc. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html.\nProcessed Combined IoT datasetThe processed combined IoT dataset is a dataset for anomaly detection, which is a type of unsupervised learning problem. It consists of a large number of IoT sensor data that are labeled as normal or abnormal. The dataset contains a total of 1,000,000 IoT sensor data records, which are categorized into 10 different types of attacks, such as DoS, Probe, U2R, R2L, etc. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iot-sensor-dataset.https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=9189760 \nClassification AlgorithmsDecision TreeDecision Trees, also known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), construct a hierarchical tree structure to make predictions. The algorithm splits data at the most optimal points, iteratively refining its predictions. After constructing the tree, pruning techniques are applied to enhance generalization to new data. For this dataset, the Decision Tree algorithm achieves exceptional results, reflecting its ability to handle binary classification tasks effectively and its robustness against overfitting.\nLogistic RegressionLogistic Regression is a binary classification technique that assumes numeric input variables with a Gaussian distribution. Although this assumption is not mandatory, the algorithm performs well even if the data does not adhere to this pattern. Logistic regression calculates coefficients for each input variable, combining them linearly into a regression function and applying a logistic transformation. While it is simple and fast, its effectiveness depends on the characteristics of the dataset. For this dataset, logistic regression may face limitations due to the non-Gaussian distribution of many attributes.\nNaive BayesNaïve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that assumes conditional independence between variables. While this assumption is unrealistic in practice, it simplifies calculations and enables efficient predictions. Naïve Bayes calculates the posterior probability for each class and predicts the class with the highest probability. Despite its simplicity, Naïve Bayes can be surprisingly effective, particularly for problems with nominal or numerical inputs assuming a specific distribution. Its performance on this dataset might be hindered by the strong interdependence among variables.\nK-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric technique that predicts outputs based on the k most similar instances in the training dataset. kNN does not build a model; instead, it relies on the raw dataset and distance-based computations during prediction. This simplicity often results in good performance, particularly for datasets where the similarity between instances is meaningful. However, kNN may be computationally expensive for large datasets and sensitive to noise in the data.\nRandom ForestRandom forest is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. It is a collection of decision trees that are trained on random subsets of the data. The algorithm combines the predictions of each tree to make a final prediction. The algorithm can handle both categorical and numerical data.\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM)Support Vector Machines are designed primarily for binary classification, though extensions support multi-class classification and regression. SVM finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data into two groups, using support vectors to define the margin. For datasets that are not linearly separable, SVM applies kernel functions such as Polynomial or RBF (Radial Basis Function) to transform the data into higher dimensions. In this dataset, SVM achieves competitive results, particularly with well-chosen kernel functions, demonstrating its ability to handle complex decision boundaries.\nMultilayer PerceptronMultilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. It is a feedforward artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of nodes. The algorithm trains the network by adjusting the weights of the connections between the nodes. The algorithm can handle both categorical and numerical data.\nEvaluation MetricsAccuracyAccuracy is the most commonly used evaluation metric for classification problems. It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.Accuracyi = (𝑇𝑃𝑖 + 𝑇𝑁𝑖) /𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒s\nPrecisionPrecision is the ratio of true positives to the total number of true positives and false positives.\n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 = 𝑇𝑃𝑖 / (𝑇𝑃i+FPi)\nRecallRecall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of true positives and false negatives.\nRecalli = 𝑇𝑃𝑖 / (𝑇𝑃i+FNi)\nF-scoreF-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nF-scorei = 2 * (precisioni * recalli) / (precisioni + recalli)\nFalse AlarmFalse alarm is the ratio of false positives to the total number of false positives and true negatives.\nFalse Alarmi = FP𝑖 / (𝑇𝑁i+FPi)\n","categories":["ai","foundation","classification algorithms"],"tags":["ai"]},{"title":"Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms","url":"/2025/06/20/ai/algorithm/02-analysis-classification-algorithms/","content":"Comparative Analysis of Classification AlgorithmsAbstractThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of three popular classification algorithms:Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron.The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare these algorithms based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and false alarm rate (www.evidentlyai.com, n.d.), using two different datasets.The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including applying multiple scalers, normalization and handling of missing values, to ensure consistency and reliability of the results.

The datasets are “NSL-KDD” AND “Processed Combined IoT dataset”. Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data, preparing the dataset for optimal model performance.\nDataset IntroductionNSL-KDDAccording to Gao(2019), the NSL-KDD dataset is a refined version of the original KDD’99 dataset, designed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS). It addresses issues like redundant records and class imbalance, providing a balanced and reliable dataset. It includes 41 features per record and categorizes attacks into four types: DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with the testing set containing unseen attack types to evaluate generalization. Widely used for IDS research, feature engineering, and algorithm evaluation, NSL-KDD remains a popular benchmark, though its lack of modern threats highlights the need for complementary dataset.\nProcessed Combined IoT datasetAccording to Alsaedi et al., the TON_IoT dataset is a new data-driven IoT/IIoT dataset. It includes heterogeneous data sources gathered from the Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services, as well as the Operating Systems logs and Network traffic of IoT network, collected from a realistic representation of a medium-scale network. The dataset has various normal and attack events for different IoT/IIoT services, and includes a combination of physical and simulated IoT/IIoT services . The TON_IoT dataset aims to address the limitations of existing datasets by providing a more representative dataset for evaluating cybersecurity solutions and machine learning methods for IoT/IIoT applications . The dataset can be accessed through the TON-IoT repository.\nAlgorithms OverviewDecision TreeWorking PrincipleA Decision Tree (scikit-learn, 2019) is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It recursively splits the dataset into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, while each leaf node represents the final predicted class or value. The tree construction process uses algorithms like ID3, CART, or C4.5, with the primary goal of reducing impurity at each split. Impurity is measured using metrics such as Gini Impurity or Entropy (for classification). The tree grows by selecting the feature that best separates the data at each node. Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, but they tend to overfit if not properly regularized.\nKey Parameters\n\nmax_depth: Limits the depth of the tree to avoid overfitting. A smaller depth prevents the model from capturing too much noise from the training data.\nmin_samples_split: Specifies the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Larger values prevent the tree from becoming too specific to the training data.\nmax_features: Defines the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Reducing this value can speed up the training process and introduce diversity in ensemble methods like Random Forest.\ncriterion: The function used to measure the quality of a split. It can be gini for Gini impurity or entropy for information gain.\n\nLogistic RegressionWorking PrincipleLogistic Regression (scikit-learn, 2014) is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression applies a logistic (sigmoid) function to the output of a linear equation to map predictions to a probability between 0 and 1. The model learns by adjusting weights assigned to each feature to minimize the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels. Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between input features and the log odds of the target variable, making it simple yet effective for many classification problems.\nLogistic Regression is widely used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in problems where the classes are linearly separable.Key Parameters\n\nC: The regularization strength. It controls the trade-off between fitting the data well and preventing overfitting. Smaller values of C apply stronger regularization (higher penalty on complexity).\nsolver: The algorithm used to optimize the weights of the model. Common solvers include liblinear, newton-cg, lbfgs, and saga. The solver choice affects convergence speed and suitability for certain datasets.\nmax_iter: The maximum number of iterations for optimization algorithms. A higher value allows the algorithm to converge more precisely, especially for complex datasets.\npenalty: The regularization technique used. Common penalties include l2 (Ridge regularization), which discourages large coefficients, and l1 (Lasso), which encourages sparsity in the model.\nmulti_class: Defines how multi-class classification is handled. Options include ovr (one-vs-rest) and multinomial. The choice depends on the problem being solved.\n\nNaive BayesWorking PrincipleNaive Bayes (scikit-learn, n.d.) is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, which calculates the posterior probability of a class given the features. It assumes independence among predictors, simplifying computations and making it efficient for high-dimensional data. Despite the naive assumption, it performs well in applications such as text classification and spam filtering. Naive Bayes is fast and computationally efficient, particularly for large datasets with independent features.Key Parameters\n\nvar_smoothing: A small additive constant to stabilize calculations and avoid division by zero when features have zero variance. Adjusting this parameter can help handle datasets with highly varying feature distributions.\n\nRandom ForestWorking PrincipleRandom Forest (scikit-learn, 2018) is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions to improve classification accuracy and control overfitting. Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and feature selection at each node ensures diversity among the trees. For classification, the output is determined by majority voting among the trees. This method excels at handling large datasets with high dimensionality and is robust against noisy data.Random Forest balances bias and variance effectively, making it suitable for diverse datasets.\nKey Parameters\n\nn_estimators: The number of trees in the forest. Increasing this value improves accuracy but can increase computational cost.\nmax_depth: The maximum depth of each tree. Limiting depth prevents overfitting while maintaining performance.\nmin_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split a node. Higher values lead to simpler trees that generalize better.\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM)Working PrincipleSVM (scikit-learn, 2019) identifies a hyperplane that separates classes with the maximum margin. It uses kernel functions to transform data into higher dimensions for non-linear separation. By maximizing the margin, SVM minimizes classification error. It is effective for both linear and non-linear problems and is robust to overfitting, especially in highdimensional spaces.SVM is versatile and powerful, particularly for datasets with complex decision boundaries.\nKey Parameters\n\nc: The regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training set and maintaining a large margin.\nkernel: Specifies the type of kernel function (e.g., linear, radial basis function (RBF), or polynomial). The choice depends on the dataset’s nature.\ngamma: The kernel coefficient for RBF and polynomial kernels, influencing the decision boundary’s flexibility. Lower values result in smoother boundaries, while higher values allow more complex boundaries.\n\nMultilayer PerceptronWorking PrincipleA Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (scikit-learn, 2010) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) composed of multiple layers of nodes (neurons). It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. MLP is used for supervised learning tasks, such as classification and regression. The network learns by adjusting weights based on the errors between predicted and actual outputs using an optimization algorithm, typically backpropagation.\nIn MLP, the input data is passed through each layer of neurons. Each neuron applies a weighted sum of inputs, followed by an activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer in classification tasks. During training, the model uses the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradient of the loss function and update the weights accordingly. The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual output (i.e., minimize the loss).\nMLP is a powerful model capable of learning complex patterns, making it well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech processing, and classification tasks that involve nonlinear decision boundaries. MLPs are versatile and can handle both simple and complex datasets. By adjusting the key parameters, MLPs can be fine-tuned for a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and more.\nKey Parameters\n\nhidden_layer_sizes: Defines the number and size of hidden layers in the network. For example, (100,) specifies a network with one hidden layer containing 100 neurons. The configuration of hidden layers affects the network**s ability to capture complex relationships.\nactivation: Specifies the activation function used in the hidden layers. Common options include:\nrelu: Rectified Linear Unit, a popular activation function that helps with faster training.\ntanh: Hyperbolic tangent, which outputs values between -1 and 1.\nlogistic: Sigmoid function, often used for binary classification tasks.\n\n\nsolver: The algorithm used for weight optimization. The common solvers are:\nadam: A popular optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate during training.\nsgd: Stochastic Gradient Descent, a basic optimizer that updates weights based on a random subset of data.\nlbfgs: A quasi-Newton method, effective for smaller datasets.\n\n\nlearning_rate: Determines how the learning rate changes during training. Options include:\nconstant: The learning rate remains constant throughout training.\ninvscaling: Gradually decreases the learning rate as training progresses.\nadaptive: The learning rate decreases when the validation score is not improving.\n\n\nmax_iter: The maximum number of iterations for optimization. More iterations generally allow for better convergence, especially on more complex datasets.\nalpha: L2 regularization term that helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. Higher values of alpha make the model simpler by forcing smaller weights.\nbatch_size: The number of samples processed before the model updates its weights. Larger batch sizes lead to more stable but slower updates, while smaller batch sizes can speed up training but result in noisier updates.\n\nEvaluation MetricsAccuracyThe accuracy indicates the proportion of samples correctly classified by the model to the total number of samples.\n\nPrecision_i= \\frac{(TP_i+TN_i)}{(Total Samples)}Among them, $TP_i$ are the true positive examples of class i  , and $FP_i$ are the false positive examples predicted as class i  from other categories.\nPrecisionPrecision is the proportion of correctly positive samples among all the samples predicted as positive. For each category i , the calculation formula for precision is:\n\nPrecision_i= \\frac{TP_i}{(TP_i+FP_i)}Among them, $TP_i$ are the true positive examples of class i  , and $FP_i$ are the false positive examples predicted as class i  from other categories.\nRecallRecall is the proportion of correctly predicted positive samples among all the actual positive samples. For each category i , the calculation formula for precision is:\n\nRecall_i= \\frac{TP_i} {(TP_i+FN_i)}Among them, $TP_i$ are the true positive examples of class i  , and $FN_i$ are the false positive examples predicted as class i  from other categories.\nF-ScoreThe F-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The calculation formula is:\n\nF_i=\\frac{(2*Precision*Recall)}{(Precision+Recall)}False AlarmFPR (False Positive Rate) is the proportion of negative samples that are incorrectly classified as positive among all actual negative samples. For each category i  , the calculation formula for the false positive rate is:\n\nFPR_i=\\frac{FP_i}{(FP_i+FP_i )}Among them, $FP_i$ are the false positive examples predicted as class i  from other categories, and $FP_i$ are the false positive examples predicted as class i  from other categories.\nResults and AnalysisPerformance MetricsDecision TreeAccording to the API documentation on scikit-learn, parameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and criterion were tuned.

For simple problems or scenarios requiring high efficiency, Decision Tree or Logistic Regression is recommended. Random Forest and MLP perform better on complex datasets but come with higher computational costs. SVM-SVC is well-suited for high-dimensional, nonlinear data, while Naïve Bayes can be effective for specific tasks such as text classification.\nReference\nAlsaedi, Abdullah, et al. “TON_IoT Telemetry Dataset: A New Generation Dataset of IoT and IIoT for Data-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems.” IEEE Access, 2020, pp. 1–1, https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3022862. \nGao, X., Shan, C., Hu, C., Niu, Z. and Liu, Z., 2019.

However, the data-driven nature of ML introduces new security challenges compared to traditional knowledge-based AI systems. Adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in ML models through a variety of adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of these systems.\nKey Attack TypesThe taxonomy of adversarial machine learning (AML) attacks identifies several important attack types, Data Access Attacks, Poisoning Attacks, Evasion Attacks, Oracle Attacks and Membership Inference Attacks. These adversarial attacks on machine learning models can affect the both training and testing stages.\nTraining StageData Access AttacksAdversaries can gain unauthorized access to the training data and manipulate the data to create a substitute model, which can be used to test and develop effective adversarial examples to attack the original target model.\nPoisoning AttacksPoisoning attacks, also know as causative attacks, are a type of adversarial attack against machine learning systems where the adversary alters the training data or model directly or indirectly to degrade the performance of the target model. This can be done through indirect poisoning, where the adversary poisons the data before pre-processing, or direct poisoning, which involves data injection, data manipulation (label or input), or logic corruption. Poisoning attacks target the training phase of the machine learning pipeline, aiming to compromise the integrity of the model by exploiting vulnerabilities in the learning process.\nTesting StageEvasion AttacksEvasion attacks are adversarial attacks that occur during the testing phase of a machine learning system, where inputs are manipulated to evade correct classification by the model. The attacker uses optimization techniques to find small perturbations that cause significant misclassification. Common algorithms for these attacks include L-BFGS, FGSM, and JSMA, which require knowledge of the target or substitute model to compute gradients.\nOracle AttacksIn Oracle Attacks, an adversary uses an API to observe model inputs and outputs, allowing them to train a substitute model similar to the target model. This substitute model can then be used to generate adversarial examples for Evasion Attacks. Oracle Attacks include Extraction Attacks, which extract model parameters, and Inversion Attacks, which reconstruct training data, potentially compromising privacy.\nMembership Inference AttacksThese attacks involve determining whether a particular data point was used to train the machine learning model.\nDefense MechanismsTo mitigate the risks posed by adversarial attacks, researchers have developed several defense mechanisms, Data Encryption and Sanitization, Robust Statistics, Adversarial Training, Gradient Masking, and Differential Privacy. These defense mechanisms aim to improve the overall security and assurance of ML components, making them more robust, resilient, and secure against a range of adversarial attacks.\n\n\n\n\nDefense Mechanisms\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nData Encryption and Sanitization\nEncrypting training data and sanitizing it to remove potential malicious samples can help protect against data access and poisoning attacks.\n\n\nRobust Statistics\nEmploying robust statistical techniques during model training can improve the model’s resilience to noisy or adversarial training data.\n\n\nAdversarial Training\nIncorporating adversarial examples into the training process can improve the model’s robustness to evasion attacks.\n\n\nGradient Masking\nObfuscating the gradients used in the optimization process can make it more difficult for adversaries to craft effective adversarial examples.\n\n\nDifferential Privacy\nApplying differential privacy techniques can help protect the privacy of the training data and mitigate membership inference attacks.\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of Adversarial AttacksThe consequences of successful adversarial attacks on ML models can be severe, leading to integrity, availability, and confidentiality violations:\n\nIntegrity Violations: Adversarial attacks can cause ML models to misclassify inputs, leading to reduced confidence in the model’s outputs or targeted misclassifications.\nAvailability Violations: Adversarial attacks can disrupt the normal operation of ML models, rendering them unusable or unavailable for their intended purposes.\nConfidentiality Violations: Adversarial attacks can lead to the extraction of sensitive information about the target ML model, such as its architecture, parameters, or training data, potentially resulting in privacy breaches.These consequences can have significant impacts on the applications and systems that rely on the security and trustworthiness of ML components, underscoring the importance of developing robust defense mechanisms to mitigate the risks of adversarial attacks.\n\n","categories":["ai","foundation","adversarial-machine-learning"],"tags":["ai"]},{"title":"Physical layer","url":"/2025/07/11/computer_basic/network/01-physical-layer/","content":"Physical LayerThe physical layer is the lowest layer in the OSI reference model.

The physical layer ensures the integrity of raw data transfer, while the network layer focuses on logical addressing and routing. Together, they enable end-to-end communication.\nFundamentals of Data CommunicationData communication involves five key components:  \n\nSender – the source of data.  \nMessage – the information to be transmitted.  \nTransmission Medium – the physical path (cable, fiber, wireless).  \nReceiver – the destination of the message.  \nProtocol – the rules governing communication.  \n\nPerformance is evaluated by bandwidth, latency, throughput, and error rate.\nTransmission TheoriesNyquist TheoremThe Nyquist criterion states that a noiseless channel with bandwidth B Hz can transmit at most 2B symbols per second.

However, understanding how network traffic flows inside and outside the cluster can still be challenging for many developers.In this post, we’ll explore three important concepts in Kubernetes networking — Port-Forward, Envoy Proxy, and Ingress — and understand how they fit together to enable secure and efficient communication in a Kubernetes environment.\nPort-Forward — Quick Access to Pods for DebuggingPort forwarding is the simplest way to access an application running inside a Kubernetes cluster from your local machine.It allows you to temporarily map a local port to a port inside a Pod, bypassing the need for complex networking configurations.\nExamplekubectl port-forward pod/my-app-pod 8080:80\nThis command forwards traffic from your local port 8080 to port 80 of the my-app-pod.You can now access the application locally using:http://localhost:8080\nWhen to Use\nDebugging or testing a service inside the cluster.\nAccessing a Pod that doesn’t expose a Service or Ingress.\nTemporary local development access.\n\nLimitations\nPort-forward is not suitable for production.\nIt only works for local, one-off connections.\nIt can become inefficient when multiple Pods or replicas are involved.\n\nEnvoy Proxy — The Modern Cloud-Native ProxyEnvoy is a high-performance, open-source edge and service proxy originally developed by Lyft.It plays a critical role in many service mesh architectures, such as Istio, and is designed to handle observability, load balancing, and security between microservices.\nKey Features\nLayer 7 (HTTP) load balancing\nTraffic routing and retries\nCircuit breaking and rate limiting\nmTLS (mutual TLS) encryption\nDetailed metrics and tracing\n\nIn Kubernetes, Envoy typically runs as a sidecar container alongside your application Pod.This pattern intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic, enabling fine-grained control over how services communicate.\nExample (Sidecar Setup)A Pod definition with Envoy sidecar might look like this:apiVersion: v1kind: Podmetadata:  name: my-custom-websitespec:  containers:  - name: my-custom-pod    image: localhost:5000/node-web    ports:    - name: http      containerPort: 8080  - name: envoy    image: luksa/kubia-ssl-proxy:1.0    ports:    - name: https      containerPort: 8443    - name: admin      containerPort: 9901\nUse Cases\nImplementing a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Consul, or Linkerd).\nSecuring inter-service communication with mTLS.\nRouting and observability in microservice architectures.\n\nIngress — Managing External Access to Your ServicesWhile Port-Forward and Envoy handle internal traffic, Ingress is how external clients reach your Kubernetes services.An Ingress is an API object that manages external HTTP and HTTPS access to services inside a cluster.It acts as an entry point, usually backed by an Ingress Controller such as NGINX, Traefik, or Envoy Gateway.\nExampleapiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1kind: Ingressmetadata:  name: my-app-ingressspec:  rules:  - host: myapp.example.com    http:      paths:      - path: /        pathType: Prefix        backend:          service:            name: my-app-service            port:              number: 80\nWith this configuration, any traffic to http://myapp.example.com will be routed to the Kubernetes Service my-app-service on port 80.\nBenefits\nCentralized control for routing and SSL termination.\nSimplifies managing multiple services under one domain.\nCan integrate with external load balancers and DNS.\n\nThings to Note\nYou must install an Ingress Controller (the Ingress resource alone doesn’t route traffic).\nConfiguration and annotations vary between controllers.\n\nComparison\n\n\n\nComponent\nPurpose\nTypical Use Case\n\n\n\n\nPort-Forward\nLocal access to a Pod\nDebugging, testing\n\n\nEnvoy Proxy\nService-to-service communication\nService mesh, mTLS, observability\n\n\nIngress\nExternal access routing\nExpose apps to the internet\n\n\n\n\nEach of these components operates at a different layer of the Kubernetes networking stack:\n\nPort-Forward → developer convenience\nEnvoy → internal microservice communication\nIngress → external user access\n\nTogether, they form the foundation of secure and efficient communication in modern Kubernetes deployments.\n","categories":["k8s","networking"],"tags":["k8s"]},{"title":"MongoDB Basic Information","url":"/2025/06/04/database/mongodb/01-install/","content":"MongoDB Basic InformationMongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use.

This allows for greater flexibility compared to traditional relational databases.\nScalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\nRich Query Language: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of operations, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.\nIndexing: MongoDB supports various types of indexes to improve query performance, including single-field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes.\nReplication: MongoDB supports replica sets, which provide high availability and data redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of data across different servers.\nAggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a robust aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing and transformation operations.\nFlexible Schema: MongoDB’s schema-less design allows for easy modifications to the data structure without requiring downtime or complex migrations.\n\nDocumentationOfficial Documentation\nInstallationInstallation\n","categories":["database","mongodb"],"tags":["mongodb"]},{"title":"Replication Support in MongoDB","url":"/2025/06/04/database/mongodb/02-replication/","content":"OverviewMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (Wikipedia Contributors 2019). Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for dynamic and hierarchical data structures. This flexibility makes it particularly suitable for applications that handle diverse and evolving data formats, such as content management systems, real-time analytics platforms, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Its scalability and performance are further enhanced by features like horizontal scaling and high availability.\nReplication SupportMongoDB implements replication through a feature called replica sets. A replica set consists of multiple MongoDB instances (nodes) that maintain the same dataset, providing redundancy and high availability (Team 2025). In a typical replica set, one node is designated as the primary, while the others serve as secondaries. The primary node handles all write operations, and the secondaries replicate the primary’s data asynchronously. If the primary node fails, an automatic election process promotes one of the secondaries to become the new primary, ensuring continuous availability.\nTo set up replication, MongoDB requires a minimum of three nodes: one primary and two secondaries (ActiveLobby Team 2021). Details in following picture. This configuration ensures fault tolerance and allows for automatic failover. Additionally, MongoDB supports the use of arbiters—nodes that participate in elections but do not hold data—to maintain an odd number of voting members, which is essential for achieving consensus during elections.\nImplications for Application DevelopmentWhen developing applications that interact with a replicated MongoDB setup, several considerations come into play:\n\nRead and Write Operations: By default, all write operations are directed to the primary node to maintain data consistency (Ishita Srivastava 2024). However, applications can be configured to read from secondary nodes to distribute the read load and improve performance. This approach, while beneficial for scalability, may introduce eventual consistency, as secondaries replicate data asynchronously.\nHandling Failover: Applications should be designed to handle automatic failovers gracefully. This involves configuring the MongoDB drivers to detect changes in the primary node and reroute operations accordingly. Proper error handling and retry mechanisms are essential to ensure seamless operation during node transitions.\nData Consistency: Developers must be aware of the consistency model of MongoDB. While reading from the primary ensures strong consistency, reading from secondaries may result in stale data due to replication lag.

Additionally, implementing caching strategies can reduce the load on the database and improve response times.\n\nIn general, while MongoDB’s replication features offer significant benefits in terms of availability and scalability, they also introduce complexities that developers must address.

Zeus is a banking trojanthat steals online financial credentials through techniques such as keylogging and formgrabbing. Fareit is a credential-stealing trojan that collects passwords, usernames, and walletdata, often delivering other malware as well. The study outlines their impacts on target systemsand highlights key traffic patterns, providing insight into how these threats can be identifiedthrough network analysis.\nZeusZeus, also known as Zbot, Wsnpoem, Kneber botnet.\nImpactsZeus is a banking trojan designed to steal online banking credentials, credit card data, andlogin information by keylogging and man-in-the-browser attacks [1]. It can also downloadadditional malware, spread via phishing emails, and build botnets for cybercrime campaigns.\nDetection PatternsIndicators include unusual encrypted HTTP traffic to command-and-control (C2) servers,domain-generation algorithm (DGA) domains, suspicious form-grabbing behaviour in webtraffic, and registry changes to maintain persistence. Network captures often show repeatedPOST requests with encoded payloads.\n\nRepeated POST requests: Frequent small POST packets sent to the same IP/domain,possibly containing encrypted credentials.\nAbnormal User-Agent: For example, uncommon browser identifiers or missing standardfields.\nPlaintext credential leakage: HTTP POST requests containing values likeusername=xxx&amp;password=xxx.\nDGA domains: Domains consisting of random-looking strings, such as abdh12kq.xyz.\n\nFareitFareit, also called Pony or Pony Loader.\nImpactsFareit is a credential-stealing trojan that harvests usernames, passwords, and cryptocurrencywallet data from infected systems [2]. It is often used to install other malware, such asransomware or banking trojans. Attackers use it to exfiltrate data to remote C2 servers,enabling identity theft and financial fraud.\nDetection PatternsIndicators include large volumes of outbound POST requests with encoded data, attempts toconnect to hardcoded C2 IPs/domains, and sudden access to browser-stored credentials orWindows credential stores.

[2]\nCentralized Management: Simplifies network administration—clients need no manualnetwork setup. [2]\nLease Renewal: Clients automatically renew or release leases before expiration. [2]\n\nNormal DHCP Operation\nDHCP DISCOVER: Client broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER to 255.255.255.255:67.\nDHCP OFFER (Unicast/Broadcast): DHCP server(s) reply with DHCPOFFER containing anavailable IP and configuration parameters.\nDHCP REQUEST (Broadcast): Client selects one offer, broadcasts DHCPREQUEST to formallyrequest it.\nDHCP ACK (Unicast): Server sends DHCPACK confirming the lease and providing fullnetwork settings.\n\nDHCP Vulnerabilities Enabling SpoofingDHCP Spoofing is a cyberattack in which a malicious actor sets up a rogue DHCP server withina network to respond to DHCP requests with malicious or misleading configurations.\nThis is possible because the DHCP protocol lacks authentication mechanisms, trusting anyserver that replies to a DHCPDISCOVER message\nHow does DHCP Spoofing work?\nDeploy: The attacker connects a rogue DHCP server (e.g., a laptop, Raspberry Pi, orcompromised IoT device) to the local network.\nRace: When a client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER, both the legitimate and rogue serversrespond. The rogue server may win by responding faster or sending more aggressive offers.\nPoison: The rogue server provides malicious network settings in its DHCPOFFER, such as:a. Attacker’s IP as the default gatewayb. Malicious DNS server addressc. Invalid subnet or routing configuration\n\nImpactBy hijacking DHCP communications, the attacker can reroute network traffic through their owndevice, giving them full visibility into—and control over—the data flow. They can also mount aDenial of Service by bombarding the legitimate DHCP server with bogus requests, depleting itspool of available IP addresses and blocking service to genuine clients. By tampering with DHCPmessages, the attacker effectively positions themselves as a man-in-the-middle, disruptingnormal traffic paths and paving the way for further malicious actions.\nPotential RiskUnderstanding the potential Risks of DHCP Spoofing is crucial for maintaining network security.Here are some risks associated with DHCP Spoofing:\n\nData Interception: Attackers can intercept sensitive data by positioning themselves as thedefault gateway or DNS server, allowing them to monitor and manipulate network traffic.[3]\nUnauthorized Network Access: Rogue DHCP servers can provide incorrect networkconfigurations, granting attackers unauthorized access to network resources and sensitiveinformation. [3]\nNetwork Disruption: DHCP Starvation attacks can deplete the DHCP server’s pool of IPaddresses, preventing legitimate devices from connecting to the network and causingsignificant disruption.[3]\n\nProtection Against DHCP SpoofingTo prevent DHCP spoofing attacks, networks can implement the following security measures:\n\nDHCP Snooping: Configure network switches to only allow DHCP responses fromtrusted ports.\nPort Security: Limit the number of MAC addresses per switch port and bind specificdevices to specific ports.\nVLAN Segmentation: Separate sensitive devices and services into different VLANs toisolate DHCP traffic.\nIP Source Guard: Used with DHCP snooping to verify IP-to-MAC bindings and blockspoofed packets.\n\nReference[1] Wikipedia Contributors, “Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,” Wikipedia, Oct. 07, 2019.[online]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol.

This message also includes the identifier of the DHCP server.Finally, h1 responds with a DHCP ACK, confirming the IP lease and providing final configuration parameters (such as router, DNS server, and lease duration).\n\nDHCP SpoofingAfter conducting this experiment, we observed that before h3 initiates the DHCP spoofing attack, h2 is able to obtain IP address information from the DHCP server running on h1. However, once h3 begins the spoofing, it continuously sends DHCP Discover messages to h1 and receives available IP addresses in response. As a result, h2 can no longer obtain an IP address from the server. This causes serious disruption to the network, potentially leading to service unavailability, denial of network access, and overall degradation of network performance.\nConclusionThis experiment successfully demonstrated the DHCP Spoofing attack within a simulated network environment using Mininet. By configuring both a legitimate DHCP server and a rogue DHCP server, we observed how the lack of authentication in the DHCP protocol can be exploited by attackers to deliver malicious IP configurations. The attacker-controlled server was able to respond to DHCPDISCOVER messages faster than the legitimate server, thereby redirecting client traffic and enabling potential man-in-the-middle attacks or denial-of-service conditions.Through this setup, we gained hands-on understanding of:\n\nThe operation of the DHCP protocol within the TCP/IP application layer.\nThe vulnerability of unauthenticated DHCP message exchanges\nThe impact of rogue DHCP servers on network reliability and security.\n\nThis experiment highlights the importance of securing network infrastructure through techniques such as DHCP Snooping, port security, and VLAN segmentation to mitigate DHCP-based attacks in real-world networks.\nReference[1] K.

In particular, we can speak about 100p-th percentiles, e.g., the 0.5-quantile is the same as the 50th percentile.\n\n0-quantile ($q_0$) = the minimum (also: numpy.min),\n0.25-quantile ($q_0.25$) = the 1st quartile (denoted  $Q_1$),\n0.5-quantile ($q_0.5$) = the 2nd quartile a.k.a. median,\n0.75-quantile ($q_0.75$) = the 3rd quartile (denoted  $Q_3$),\n1-quantile ( $q_1$ ) = the maximum (also: numpy.max).\n\nnp.quantile(income, [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1])np.quantile(heights, [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1])\nMeasures of DispersionMeasures of central tendency quantify the location of the most typical value.\n\nthe standard deviation: being the average distance to the arithmetic mean\n\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\bar{x})^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - \\bar{x})^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 }.\nthe interquartile range (IQR), being the difference between the 3rd and the 1st quartile:\n\nIQR = q_0.75 - q_0.25 = Q3 - Q1\n\nnp.std(income), np.quantile(income, 0.75)-np.quantile(income, 0.25)np.std(heights), np.quantile(heights, 0.75)-np.quantile(heights, 0.25)\nThe IQR has an appealing interpretation, because we may say that this is the range comprised of the 50% most typical values.\nThe standard deviation measures the average degree of spread around the arithmetic mean. Thus, it makes the most sense for data distributions that are symmetric around the mean. This measure is useful overall for making comparisons across different samples.

It summarizes three major research directions: data-level methods (oversampling, undersampling, synthetic sample generation), algorithm-level methods (cost-sensitive learning, specialized classifiers, ensemble or boosting techniques), and proper evaluation practices that move beyond simple accuracy toward metrics like precision–recall, F-measure, and AUC. The editorial emphasizes that imbalanced-data problems remain difficult due to issues such as noisy minority samples, class overlap, and lack of standardized benchmarks, and calls for consistent evaluation protocols and deeper investigation into modern settings such as deep learning, streaming data, and extreme imbalance.\n\nAssessing classifiers for imbalanced dataassessing classifiers for imbalanced data\n“Learning from Imbalanced Data” deals with the problem that, in many real-world tasks (fraud detection, disease diagnosis, anomaly detection, etc.), the class of interest (e.g. fraud, disease, anomaly) is very rare compared to the majority class. Standard machine-learning algorithms often fail on such datasets because they assume balanced classes and minimize overall error — leading them to ignore the minority class and yield misleadingly high accuracy by just predicting the majority class. To handle this, the literature proposes methods including data-level strategies (oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority, synthetic sample generation like SMOTE), algorithm-level strategies (cost-sensitive learning, adjusted decision thresholds, specialized learners), and hybrid / ensemble methods combining both. Moreover, proper evaluation metrics — such as precision/recall, F1-score, AUC — are essential, because accuracy alone is misleading in imbalanced settings. Despite many advances, the field still faces challenges: noisy or overlapping data, small sample size for minority class, lack of standard benchmarks, and difficulties extending classical methods to modern contexts (deep learning, streaming data, regression tasks). The work calls for principled methods, consistent evaluation standards, and continued research especially in long-tail and deep-learning settings.\n\nData level methodsdata level methods\nSMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a widely used method for handling imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic minority-class samples instead of simply duplicating existing ones. It works by selecting a minority instance, finding its k nearest minority neighbors, and creating new samples by interpolating points along the line segments between the instance and its neighbors. This enlarges the decision space of the minority class and reduces the bias of standard classifiers toward the majority class, often improving recall and overall minority-class performance. However, SMOTE does not consider the distribution of the majority class, which can cause synthetic samples to appear in overlapping or noisy regions, potentially harming performance. Later research also shows that SMOTE may distort the true minority distribution in high-dimensional or complex feature spaces, motivating many variants (e.g., Borderline-SMOTE, Safe-SMOTE) to address these limitations.\n\npython implementation of SMOTE\nCost sensitive approachesCost sensitive learningLearning from imbalanced data focuses on addressing classification problems where one class is significantly underrepresented, causing standard machine-learning algorithms to become biased toward the majority class. The paper reviews three major solution categories: data-level methods such as oversampling, undersampling, and synthetic sample generation (e.g., SMOTE); algorithm-level methods that modify learning objectives with cost-sensitive training, adjusted decision thresholds, or ensemble techniques like boosting and bagging; and hybrid approaches that combine resampling with specialized classifiers. It highlights that imbalance interacts with other difficulties — noise, small sample sizes, and class overlap — and therefore robust solutions must consider data quality and distribution, not just class proportions. The paper concludes by emphasizing that no single method works universally, and effective handling of imbalanced data typically requires careful experimentation, evaluation using metrics like recall, precision, F-measure, and ROC/PR curves, and the use of tailored algorithms designed to enhance minority-class recognition.\n\nCost sensitive AdaBoostCost-sensitive boosting for imbalanced data modifies traditional boosting (e.g. AdaBoost) by incorporating misclassification costs into the weight-updating and loss minimization process, so that errors on the minority class are penalized more heavily than errors on the majority class. The paper introduces several boosting algorithms that embed cost items into the boosting framework: by adjusting the weight update formulas, they bias the learning process toward correctly classifying the minority (rare) class rather than optimizing overall accuracy. Empirical experiments on real-world imbalanced datasets — often from critical domains like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, or anomaly detection — show that these cost-sensitive boosting methods substantially improve minority-class detection (e.g. higher recall / sensitivity), compared with naïve boosting or standard classifiers. Because boosting combines many weak learners and reweights samples iteratively, cost-sensitive boosting can preserve more information than naive sampling methods while effectively focusing on rare but important cases.\n\nThe Foundations of Cost-Sensitive Learning\nThe Foundations of Cost-Sensitive Learning investigates the problem of classification when different types of misclassification errors have different penalties (costs). The paper precisely defines when a cost matrix is “reasonable” (i.e., economically and statistically coherent) and warns against arbitrarily chosen cost matrices that might lead to inconsistent or irrational decision rules. For the binary-class case, it proves a theorem showing how, given a cost matrix and class priors, one can derive an optimal decision rule — which may differ from the standard equal-cost decision threshold. The paper further argues that simply rebalancing or resampling the training set does not guarantee optimal cost-sensitive decisions under many classifiers (e.g. Bayesian or decision-tree learners). Instead, the recommended approach is to train a probabilistic classifier on the data “as is,” then apply the cost matrix at decision time to choose class labels that minimize expected cost, thus decoupling model training from decision making.\n\n","categories":["da"],"tags":["da"]},{"title":"Outlier","url":"/2025/11/11/big_data/da/07-des-statistics/","content":"Outliersimport numpy as npimport pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snspd.set_option(&quot;display.notebook_repr_html&quot;, False)  # disable &quot;rich&quot; outputplt.style.use(&quot;seaborn&quot;)\nUnidimensional Datax = np.loadtxt(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagolews/&quot; +    &quot;teaching-data/master/marek/blobs2.txt&quot;)plt.subplot(121)sns.boxplot(data=x, orient=&quot;h&quot;)plt.subplot(122)sns.histplot(x, binwidth=1)plt.show()\nMultidimensional Datax = np.loadtxt(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagolews/&quot; +    &quot;teaching-data/master/marek/blobs1.txt&quot;, delimiter=&quot;,&quot;)plt.subplot(221)sns.boxplot(data=x[:, 0], orient=&quot;h&quot;)plt.subplot(222)sns.histplot(x[:, 0], bins=20)plt.title(&quot;x[:, 0]&quot;)plt.subplot(223)sns.boxplot(data=x[:, 1], orient=&quot;h&quot;)plt.subplot(224)sns.histplot(x[:, 1], bins=20)plt.title(&quot;x[:, 1]&quot;)plt.show()\nMultidimensional Datax = np.loadtxt(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gagolews/&quot; +    &quot;teaching-data/master/marek/blobs1.txt&quot;, delimiter=&quot;,&quot;)plt.subplot(221)sns.boxplot(data=x[:, 0], orient=&quot;h&quot;)plt.subplot(222)sns.histplot(x[:, 0], bins=20)plt.title(&quot;x[:, 0]&quot;)plt.subplot(223)sns.boxplot(data=x[:, 1], orient=&quot;h&quot;)plt.subplot(224)sns.histplot(x[:, 1], bins=20)plt.title(&quot;x[:, 1]&quot;)plt.show()\nplt.scatter(x[:, 0], x[:, 1])plt.axis(&quot;equal&quot;)plt.show()x[-8:, :]\nimport scipy.spatialt = scipy.spatial.KDTree(x)n = t.query_ball_tree(t, 0.2)  # epsilon=0.2 (radius)c = np.array([len(e) for e in n])c[[0, 1, -2, -1]]  # preview\nplt.scatter(x[c &gt; 1, 0], x[c &gt; 1, 1], label=&quot;normal point&quot;)plt.scatter(x[c == 1, 0], x[c == 1, 1], marker=&quot;v&quot;, label=&quot;outlier&quot;)plt.axis(&quot;equal&quot;)plt.legend()plt.show()\nDistance-based outlier detectionK-nearest neighbour (KNN)[1] Edwin Knorr and Raymond Ng. Algorithms for mining distance-based outliers in large datasets. In Proc. of the VLDB Conference, pages 392–403, New York, USA, September 1998.Read Section 3.1 of the paper\nThis paper proposes an intuitive and general distance-based definition of outliers, where a data point’s “degree of being an outlier” is measured by its distance to the k-th nearest neighbor, and the top n points with the largest distances are considered outliers. To address the high computational cost on large datasets, the authors designed an efficient partition-based pruning algorithm that can exclude partitions that cannot contain outliers in advance, significantly reducing computation. Experimental results show that this method performs well and scales effectively on large and high-dimensional datasets, making it suitable for applications such as database cleaning, fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and IoT sensor data analysis.\nHowever, the method still depends on the choice of parameters n and k, may suffer from distance degradation in high-dimensional spaces, and is sensitive to data standardization and distance metrics. Overall, this paper is pioneering in the field of outlier detection, offering both theoretical significance and practical applicability.\nDensity-based outlier detectionLocal outlier factor (LOF) algorithmRead Definition 3, of the paper\nThe LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm is a density-based local outlier detection method. It measures the degree of abnormality of each data point by comparing its local density with that of its neighbors. Specifically, it computes the local reachability density (lrd) of each point and then forms the LOF value as the ratio of the average density of its neighbors to its own density. An LOF value close to 1 indicates that the point has a density similar to its neighbors and is considered normal, while a significantly larger value indicates local sparsity and a potential outlier. The algorithm is particularly effective for detecting local outliers in datasets with varying density or irregular cluster shapes.\nThe advantages of LOF include its independence from predefined clusters or distribution assumptions, its continuous outlier scoring, and strong adaptability to complex data structures. However, it is sensitive to the choice of the neighborhood parameter k, requires experience-based thresholding for LOF values, and has relatively high computational complexity, making it less efficient for large-scale, high-dimensional, or streaming data. LOF is widely applied in anomaly detection, data cleaning, IoT sensor data analysis, and network traffic monitoring.\n\nRead Page 6 of the paper\n\n\n\n\nMethod Category\nCore Idea\nMain Algorithms / Representative Methods\nAdvantages\nLimitations / Notes\nSuitable Scenarios\n\n\n\n\nStatistical-based\nAssume data follows a certain distribution; detect outliers based on probability or deviation\nZ-score, Grubbs Test, Mixture Models\nSimple and intuitive; works well for low-dimensional, known-distribution data\nDepends on distribution assumption; less effective in high dimensions\nData quality checking, low-dimensional sensor data\n\n\nDistance / Nearest Neighbor\nPoints far from others are likely outliers\nk-NN Outlier, Distance-based Outlier\nDistribution-free; intuitive\nHigh computational cost in high-dimensional or large datasets; needs parameter k\nIoT, RFID, trajectory anomaly detection\n\n\nDensity-based\nCompare local density of a point with its neighbors\nLOF (Local Outlier Factor), DBSCAN Outlier\nDetects local outliers; handles varying density\nSensitive to parameter k; computationally intensive\nLocal outlier detection, datasets with varying density\n\n\nClustering-based\nOutliers do not belong to major clusters or belong to small clusters\nK-means Outlier, DBSCAN Outlier\nCan detect isolated points outside clusters\nSensitive to clustering quality; hard with noise or high-dimensional data\nData exploration, cluster-based anomaly detection\n\n\nLearning / ML-based\nUse supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised models to predict outliers\nOne-class SVM, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder\nHandles high-dimensional and complex data\nRequires training; parameter tuning can be complex\nNetwork intrusion detection, anomaly pattern recognition\n\n\nHybrid / Ensemble\nCombine multiple methods to improve robustness\nFeature Bagging + LOF, Ensemble k-NN\nImproves detection accuracy; reduces false positives\nHigh complexity; high computational cost\nHigh-dimensional, complex, or large-scale data\n\n\n\n\n\nlof\nPython scikit-learn (aka sklearn) has a page about LOF\nClustering-based outlier detectionModified k-means and minimum spanning treeRead Algorithm 3.1 and 3.2 of the paper\nThis paper proposes an outlier detection method based on a two-phase clustering process combined with a minimum spanning tree (MST). In the first phase, a modified k-means clustering is applied, where points far from existing cluster centers are treated as new cluster centers, allowing isolated or sparse outliers to form independent clusters. In the second phase, an MST is constructed using the cluster centers, and the longest edges are removed to split the tree into subtrees, identifying outliers in small or isolated clusters. This approach leverages both clustering and graph structure, effectively detecting few and sparsely distributed outliers while providing good interpretability.\nThe method’s advantages include independence from data distribution assumptions and the ability to detect isolated/sparse outliers, making it suitable for static and multi-modal datasets. Its limitations are sensitivity to parameters (such as initial k and distance thresholds), higher computational cost for high-dimensional or large-scale data, and reduced effectiveness for dense anomalous clusters or streaming data. The method is particularly suitable for scenarios like IoT, RFID, and sensor trajectory data where outliers are sparse and batch processing is feasible.\n\nDensity-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) SectionRead Section 7.1 of the paper\n\n\n\n\nMethod Category\nCore Idea\nRepresentative Methods / Algorithms\nAdvantages\nLimitations / Notes\nSuitable Scenarios\n\n\n\n\nStatistical-based\nAssume data follows a certain distribution;

The book highlights that data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and noisy, and that data matching aims to identity records referring to the same real-world entity under these imperfect conditions. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, the book presents data matching as a structured process that includes data preprocessing, indexing, similarity comparison, match classification, and evaluation.\n\nEntity Resolution%20All%20of%20Entity%20Resolution.pdf?ou=1761137)\n“(Almost) All of Entity Resolution” provides a comprehensive literature review of the entity resolution problem, which aims to systematically identify and merge multiple recors that refer to the same real-world entity across noisy and heterogeneous data sources. The paper traces the foundational history of the field from early probabilistic linkage methods in the mid-20th century to modern probabilistic and supervised machine learning approaches. It discusses deterministic and similarity-based techniques, extensions of classical probabilistic frameworks, clustering-based resolution methods, and recent advances in uncertainty quantification. Through practical examples spanning census data, human rights records, citation network, and medical data, it highlights both theoratical and practical challenges of entity resolution. \n","categories":["da"],"tags":["da"]},{"title":"GDPR","url":"/2025/11/13/big_data/da/10-des-statistics/","content":"General Data Protection RegulationGDPRThe General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the European Union to enhance individuals’ control over their personal data to harmonise data protection rules across EU member states.\nGDPR was introduced in response to rapid technological developments and the increasing scale of personal data processing in the digital economy.\nGDPR emphasises the protection of individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the right to data protection. The regulation stengthens data subject rights by granting individuals greater control over how their personal data is collected and used. GDPR aims to harmonise data protection laws across the EU, creating a consistent regulatory framework.\nPersonal data under GDPR includes any information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. The data subject refers to an identifiable individual whose personal data is being processed. GDPR clearly distinguishes between data controllers and data processors, assigning different responsibilities to each.\nUnder GDPR, personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, and must be based on a valid lawful basis such as consent or contractual necessity. GDPR significantly enhances individual rights, including the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object.\nThe substantial administrative fines under GDPR serve as a strong deterrent against non-compliance.\nIn conclusion, GDPR represents a significant advancement in data protection law by reinforcing individual rights, enhancing transparency, and establishing a unified regulatory framework across the European Union.
